Most users are expected to use a released version of the operator, but
if you're testing or want to use a pre-released version of of the
release yamls, you may want to build your own copy of the operator.

## Installing from source

You can install the Knative Operator from the source code using the [ko](https://github.com/google/ko) build tool.

1. Download the source code:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/knative/operator.git
    ```

1. Install the Operator in the root directory of the source:

    ```
    ko apply -f config/
    ```

## Release yamls

The operator bundles the last N=4 releases of Knative components in
`/cmd/operator/kodata/` in various subdirectories. A few notes:

* The `kodata` files can be automatically regenerated by running
  `./hack/update-codegen.sh` or the `cmd/fetcher` command; it has a
  configuration for fetching updates in its own `kodata` directory.

* If you only want to update the yaml files, you can also mount a
  volume over `/var/run/kodata` (or set `$KO_DATA_PATH`) on the
  operator to pick up different yaml files. You can combine this with
  a `ReadWriteMany` volume (or a sidecar) to be able to update the
  yaml files live on-cluster without rebuilding the operator image.
