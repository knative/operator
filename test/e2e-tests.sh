# This script runs the end-to-end tests against Knative Serving
# Operator built from source.  It is started by prow for each PR. For
# convenience, it can also be executed manually.

# If you already have a Knative cluster setup and kubectl pointing
# to it, call this script with the --run-tests arguments and it will use
# the cluster and run the tests.

# Calling this script without arguments will create a new cluster in
# project $PROJECT_ID, start knative in it, run the tests and delete the
# cluster.
