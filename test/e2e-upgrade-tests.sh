# This script runs the end-to-end tests against Knative Serving
# Operator built from source. However, this script will download the latest
# source code of knative serving and generated the latest manifest file for
# serving installation. The serving operator will use this newly generated
# manifest file to replace the one under the directory
# cmd/manager/kodata/knative-serving. This purpose of this script is to verify
# whether the latest source code of operator can work properly with the latest
# source code of knative serving.

# If you already have a Knative cluster setup and kubectl pointing
# to it, call this script with the --run-tests arguments and it will use
# the cluster and run the tests.

# Calling this script without arguments will create a new cluster in
# project $PROJECT_ID, start knative in it, run the tests and delete the
# cluster.
