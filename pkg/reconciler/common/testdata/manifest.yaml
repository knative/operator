    # This block is not actually functional configuration,

    # options and document them in a way that is accessible

    #
    # These sample configuration options may be copied out of
    # this example block and unindented to be in the data block
    # to actually change the configuration.

    # The Revision ContainerConcurrency field specifies the maximum number
    # of requests the Container can handle at once. Container concurrency
    # target percentage is how much of that maximum to use in a stable
    # state. E.g. if a Revision specifies ContainerConcurrency of 10, then
    # the Autoscaler will try to maintain 7 concurrent connections per pod
    # on average.
    # Note: this limit will be applied to container concurrency set at every
    # level (ConfigMap, Revision Spec or Annotation).
    # For legacy and backwards compatibility reasons, this value also accepts
    # fractional values in (0, 1] interval (i.e. 0.7 â‡’ 70%).
    # Thus minimal percentage value must be greater than 1.0, or it will be
    # treated as a fraction.
    container-concurrency-target-percentage: "70"

    # The container concurrency target default is what the Autoscaler will
    # try to maintain when concurrency is used as the scaling metric for a
    # Revision and the Revision specifies unlimited concurrency.
    # Even when specifying unlimited concurrency, the autoscaler will
    # horizontally scale the application based on this target concurrency.
    # NOTE: Only one metric can be used for autoscaling a Revision.
    container-concurrency-target-default: "100"

    # The requests per second (RPS) target default is what the Autoscaler will
    # try to maintain when RPS is used as the scaling metric for a Revision and
    # the Revision specifies unlimited RPS. Even when specifying unlimited RPS,
    # the autoscaler will horizontally scale the application based on this
    # target RPS.
    # Must be greater than 1.0.
    # NOTE: Only one metric can be used for autoscaling a Revision.
    requests-per-second-target-default: "200"

    # The target burst capacity specifies the size of burst in concurrent
    # requests that the system operator expects the system will receive.
    # Autoscaler will try to protect the system from queueing by introducing
    # Activator in the request path if the current spare capacity of the
    # service is less than this setting.
    # If this setting is 0, then Activator will be in the request path only
    # when the revision is scaled to 0.
    # If this setting is > 0 and container-concurrency-target-percentage is
    # 100% or 1.0, then activator will always be in the request path.
    # -1 denotes unlimited target-burst-capacity and activator will always
    # be in the request path.
    # Other negative values are invalid.

    # average concurrency over the stable window.
    # Stable window must be in whole seconds.
    stable-window: "60s"

    # When observed average concurrency during the panic window reaches
    # panic-threshold-percentage the target concurrency, the autoscaler
    # enters panic mode. When operating in panic mode, the autoscaler
    # scales on the average concurrency over the panic window which is
    # panic-window-percentage of the stable-window.
    # When computing the panic window it will be rounded to the closest
    # whole second.

    # enter panic mode when reached within the panic window.
    panic-threshold-percentage: "200.0"

    # Max scale up rate limits the rate at which the autoscaler will
    # increase pod count. It is the maximum ratio of desired pods versus
    # observed pods.
    # Cannot less or equal to 1.
    # I.e with value of 2.0 the number of pods can at most go N to 2N
    # over single Autoscaler period (see tick-interval), but at least N to
    # N+1, if Autoscaler needs to scale up.

    # Cannot less or equal to 1.
    # I.e. with value of 2.0 the number of pods can at most go N to N/2
    # over single Autoscaler evaluation period (see tick-interval), but at

    # This block is not actually functional configuration,
    # but serves to illustrate the available configuration
    # options and document them in a way that is accessible
    # to users that `kubectl edit` this config map.
    #
    # These sample configuration options may be copied out of
    # this example block and unindented to be in the data block
    # to actually change the configuration.

    # DEPRECATED:
    # istio.sidecar.includeOutboundIPRanges is obsolete.
    # The current versions have outbound network access enabled by default.
    # If you need this option for some reason, please use global.proxy.includeIPRanges in Istio.
    #
    # istio.sidecar.includeOutboundIPRanges: "*"

    # ingress.class specifies the default ingress class
    # to use when not dictated by Route annotation.
    #
    # If not specified, will use the Istio ingress.
    #
    # Note that changing the Ingress class of an existing Route
    # will result in undefined behavior.  Therefore it is best to only
    # update this value during the setup of Knative, to avoid getting
    # undefined behavior.
    ingress.class: "istio.ingress.networking.knative.dev"

    # certificate.class specifies the default Certificate class
    # to use when not dictated by Route annotation.
    #
    # If not specified, will use the Cert-Manager Certificate.
    #
    # Note that changing the Certificate class of an existing Route
    # will result in undefined behavior.  Therefore it is best to only
    # update this value during the setup of Knative, to avoid getting
    # undefined behavior.
    certificate.class: "cert-manager.certificate.networking.knative.dev"

    # domainTemplate specifies the golang text template string to use
    # when constructing the Knative service's DNS name. The default
    # value is "{{.Name}}.{{.Namespace}}.{{.Domain}}". And those three
    # values (Name, Namespace, Domain) are the only variables defined.
    #
    # Changing this value might be necessary when the extra levels in
    # the domain name generated is problematic for wildcard certificates
    # that only support a single level of domain name added to the
    # certificate's domain. In those cases you might consider using a value
    # of "{{.Name}}-{{.Namespace}}.{{.Domain}}", or removing the Namespace
    # entirely from the template. When choosing a new value be thoughtful
    # of the potential for conflicts - for example, when users choose to use
    # characters such as `-` in their service, or namespace, names.
    # {{.Annotations}} can be used for any customization in the go template if needed.
    # We strongly recommend keeping namespace part of the template to avoid domain name clashes
    # Example '{{.Name}}-{{.Namespace}}.{{ index .Annotations "sub"}}.{{.Domain}}'
    # and you have an annotation {"sub":"foo"}, then the generated template would be {Name}-{Namespace}.foo.{Domain}
    domainTemplate: "{{.Name}}.{{.Namespace}}.{{.Domain}}"

    # tagTemplate specifies the golang text template string to use
    # when constructing the DNS name for "tags" within the traffic blocks
    # of Routes and Configuration.  This is used in conjunction with the
    # domainTemplate above to determine the full URL for the tag.
    tagTemplate: "{{.Tag}}-{{.Name}}"

    # Controls whether TLS certificates are automatically provisioned and
    # installed in the Knative ingress to terminate external TLS connection.
    # 1. Enabled: enabling auto-TLS feature.
    # 2. Disabled: disabling auto-TLS feature.
    autoTLS: "Disabled"

    # Controls the behavior of the HTTP endpoint for the Knative ingress.
    # It requires autoTLS to be enabled.
    # 1. Enabled: The Knative ingress will be able to serve HTTP connection.
    # 2. Disabled: The Knative ingress will reject HTTP traffic.
    # 3. Redirected: The Knative ingress will send a 302 redirect for all
    # http connections, asking the clients to use HTTPS
    httpProtocol: "Enabled"

    # An example use case is when users want to use Istio without any
    # sidecar injection (like Knative's istio-ci-no-mesh.yaml).  Since every pod
    # is outside of the service mesh in that case, a cluster-local  service
    # will need to be exposed to a cluster-local gateway to be accessible.
